# Prospero-X1-mod
Some scripts to kill original mining software and run the custom (lightweight) one
Point is to create script that can automatically
- install another cgminer in paraler with original, so in some directory of "ba" user (prospero is default for now)
- kill the original one including web UI
- copy config from original or create config teplate for Prospero X-1 or 1.5
- prepare start and shutdown scripts to allow simple control over ssh (ssh miner 'sh start/stop' or similar)
